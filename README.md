Netflix_BI_Project

I created a Netflix dataset using AI-generated prompts and built an interactive Power BI dashboard. The dataset includes show details like title, type, cast, country, release year, rating, and genre. The dashboard visualizes trends and insights, demonstrating end-to-end data creation, analysis, and visualization.

Project Summary
The Netflix BI Project is an end-to-end data visualization and storytelling initiative built using Power BI. The project begins with an AI-generated Netflix dataset, carefully curated to replicate real-world streaming data involving movies and TV shows, including their genres, countries, ratings, release years, durations, and other key attributes. This dataset was designed to simulate Netflix’s content distribution and performance data, ensuring realism and analytical depth.

Using this dataset, I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard that delivers a comprehensive overview of Netflix’s content strategy and audience insights. The dashboard highlights critical metrics such as the distribution of Movies vs TV Shows, popular genres across countries, rating-based segmentation, and yearly content release trends. Each visualization provides a unique perspective on how Netflix structures its global library, empowering users to explore data through filters and drill-downs.

Key Objectives
- To understand content distribution across types, genres, and regions.  
- To explore release trends and identify the growth trajectory of Netflix’s content.  
- To visualize audience-oriented classifications using ratings and categories.  
- To demonstrate Power BI proficiency through dynamic visuals and calculated KPIs.  

Tools & Technologies
- Microsoft Power BI: Dashboard creation and DAX-based calculations  
- Microsoft Excel / CSV: AI-generated dataset preparation  
- Power Query: Data transformation and model design  
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Custom KPI and measure calculations  

Dashboard Highlights
- KPI Cards: Total Titles, Number of Movies, Number of TV Shows  
- Bar Chart: Top 10 Countries by Content Count  
- Pie Chart: Distribution of Content by Rating  
- Line Chart: Yearly Release Trends  
- Treemap: Popular Genres and Category Segments  
- Table Visual: Detailed view with filters for title, release year, and rating  

Insights
- Netflix’s library is dominated by Movies, but TV Shows have shown consistent growth in recent years.  
- The United States, India, and the United Kingdom have the largest volume of Netflix content.  
- TV-MA and TV-14 are the most common ratings, indicating Netflix’s focus on general and mature audiences.  
- Genres like Drama, Comedy, and International Movies remain the platform’s most popular categories.  

Learning Outcomes Through this project, I strengthened my ability to:
- Design AI-generated datasets suitable for business analysis.  
- Apply Power Query and DAX to create dynamic KPIs and relationships.  
- Build interactive dashboards with filters, hierarchies, and tooltips.  
- Translate data into clear, business-oriented insights for decision-making.  

Future Enhancements
- Integrating a prediction layer using Python (e.g., predicting popular genres).  
- Adding content trend forecasting using time-series analysis.  
- Incorporating user engagement and rating-based analytics for deeper insights.
